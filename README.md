# ⚡ HabitUp

A habit and task tracking application with an Angular frontend and a .NET backend using SQLite for persistent storage.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure the following are installed:

| Tool | Download |
|---|---|
| [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org) | Required for Angular |
| [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) | Required for the backend |
| [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) | `npm install -g @angular/cli` |
| [EF Core CLI Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) | `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` |

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/HabitUp.git
cd HabitUp
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend/HabitUp.API
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update
```

`dotnet ef database update` creates the `habitup.db` SQLite database file and applies the schema. This only needs to be run once.

### 3. Set up the frontend

```bash
cd frontend/HabitUp-UI
npm install
```

---

## Running the App

Both the backend and frontend need to be running at the same time. Open two terminals.

**Terminal 1 — Backend:**
```bash
cd backend/HabitUp.API
dotnet run
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:5245`. You can explore the endpoints at `http://localhost:5245/swagger`.

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend/HabitUp-UI
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
```
Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`.

## Using the App

### Creating a task
Click **+ Create Task** in the top right. Fill in the title (required, max 50 characters), an optional description (max 200 characters), a start date, and an optional completion interval in days (e.g. 7 for weekly, 30 for monthly). Leave the interval blank for one-time tasks.

### Completing a task
Click the **checkbox in the top left of a task card** to mark it complete for the day. Clicking it again the same day will undo the completion. Clicking it on a different day will not undo previous completions.

### Auto-reset
Tasks with a completion interval are automatically unchecked once the interval has passed, so they are ready to be completed again.

### Editing and deleting
Use the **Edit** and **Delete** buttons on each card. Deletion requires a confirmation step.

### Stats
Click **View Stats** on any task to see how many times it has been completed and your completion rate. Multiple stats panels can be open at the same time.

### Search
Type in the **search bar** in the header to find a task by title. Select a result from the dropdown to jump to that task — it will move to the top of the list and briefly glow to show you where it is.

### Reordering
**Drag and drop** task cards to arrange them in any order you like.
